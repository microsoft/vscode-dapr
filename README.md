The Dapr extension makes it easy to setup debugging of applications within the Dapr environment as well as interact with applications via the Dapr runtime.

## Prerequisites

### Docker

Local development with Dapr requires a running instance of Docker; follow the [Docker guide](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to installing Docker Desktop for your platform.

### Dapr CLI and Runtime

Follow the [Dapr guide](https://dapr.io/#download) to install the Dapr CLI for your platform and initialize the Dapr runtime.

> This extension requires Dapr 0.5.0 or later.

### Visual Studio Code

This extension requires Visual Studio Code version 1.42 and above; follow the [VS Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for installing VS Code for your platform.

## Feature Overview

### Scaffold Dapr task, launch, and component assets

While extensions for Visual Studio Code make it easy to debug applications for a variety of platforms (like .NET Core, Node.js, Python, etc.), coordinating the debugger with the Dapr runtime can be tricky. The Dapr extension helps scaffold VS Code tasks, augments debug launch configurations, and generates the Dapr component assets needed to debug your application within the Dapr environment.

### View running Dapr applications

The Dapr extension adds a new tab which shows locally-running Dapr applications and allows quickly invoking application methods or publishing events.

### Invoke Dapr application methods

When your application is running, you can quickly invoke its GET/POST methods without using a command line or switching to another HTTP request tool, including specifying an optional payload for POST methods.

### Publish events to Dapr applications

You can also use the extension to directly publish events to running applications, specifying both the topic and an optional payload.
