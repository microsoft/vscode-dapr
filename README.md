The Dapr extension makes it easy to setup debugging of applications within the Dapr environment as well as interact with applications via the Dapr runtime.

## Prerequisites

### Platforms

Supported platforms:

 - MacOS
 - Linux
 - Windows

> Dapr 1.12 or later is required to use Dapr "Run Files" on Windows (outside of WSL).

### Docker

Local development with Dapr requires a running instance of Docker; follow the [Docker guide](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to installing Docker Desktop for your platform.

### Dapr CLI and Runtime

Follow the [Dapr guide](https://dapr.io/#download) to install the Dapr CLI for your platform and initialize the Dapr runtime.

> This extension requires:
> - Dapr CLI version 1.10.0 or later
> - Dapr Runtime version 1.10.0 or later

### Visual Studio Code

Follow the [VS Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for installing VS Code for your platform.

> This extension requires Visual Studio Code version 1.82.0 or later.

## Feature Overview

### Dapr Run File Support

Dapr 1.10 enables starting multiple Dapr applications through the use of a "run file", and the Dapr extension allows you to start the "run" directly from the File Explorer.

The Dapr extension also allows you to start multiple Dapr applications through a single `dapr` task by just referencing the run file.

Sample `tasks.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "dapr",
            "type": "dapr",
            "runFile": "./dapr.yaml"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Run File Editing Assistence

When working with Dapr run files, the extension provides you with basic schema prompts and validation:

### Dapr Application Debugging

Dapr CLI 1.10 now tracks the application started via `dapr run`, which enables the Dapr extension to attach the debugger to running instances, whether started inside or outside of VS Code, directly from the Dapr applications view.

The debugger can be attached to individual applications, or to all applications in a run.

The Dapr extension also enables "F5" debugging of Dapr applications through a new custom debug launch configuration, which will automatically start and attach to the applications.  Individual applications can be included or excluded from the set of applications the debugger attaches to.

Sample `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Dapr",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dapr",
            "runFile": "${workspaceFolder}/dapr.yaml",
            "includeApps": ["csharp-subscriber", "node-subscriber"],
            "preLaunchTask": "dapr"
        }
    ]
}
```

### View Dapr Logs

When using Dapr run files, Dapr redirects the application and Dapr sidecar logs to application-specific locations (rather than writing them to the console). The Dapr extension enables you to open these logs directly from the Dapr applications view.

### Scaffold Dapr task, launch, and component assets

While extensions for Visual Studio Code make it easy to debug applications for a variety of platforms (like .NET Core, Node.js, Python, etc.), coordinating the debugger with the Dapr runtime can be tricky. The Dapr extension helps scaffold VS Code tasks, augments debug launch configurations, and (optionally) generates the Dapr component assets needed to debug your application within the Dapr environment.

### View running Dapr applications

The Dapr extension adds a new tab which shows locally-running Dapr applications and allows quickly invoking application methods or publishing events.

### Invoke Dapr application methods

When your application is running, you can quickly invoke its GET/POST methods without using a command line or switching to another HTTP request tool, including specifying an optional payload for POST methods.

### Publish events to Dapr applications

You can also use the extension to directly publish events to running applications, specifying both the topic and an optional payload.

### Stop Dapr applications

The Dapr extension allows you to directly stop locally-running applications without using the command line.
